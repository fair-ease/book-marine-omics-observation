# Marine Omics Observation Pilot

Starting from an ongoing effort undertaken by the EMBRC infrastructure, with the establishment of the European Marine Omics Biodiversity Observation Network (EMO-BON), this pilot focuses on the challenge to set up a **web-based VRE to provide products and services orientated to non-specialist researchers interested in omics approaches to study marine biodiversity**.

As of today, EMO-BON includes 20+  marine stations that sample for genomic microbial marine biodiversity, essential ocean variables (EOVs), and essential biological variables (EBVs).

This book provides:

1. Introduction to the pilot architecture.
2. Comprehensive overview of the data and software products developed.
3. Pointers to additional resources, with emphasis on the interactive ones.
4. Semi-interactive results of the exploratory analysis of the EMO-BON data.
