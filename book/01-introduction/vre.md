## General Principles

We have foreseen to develop 3 distinct end-user facing apps.

1. a generic data-explorer - including an open browse/find UI and a found sample visualiser.
2. (demonstrator) *Bioprospecting  Service*
3. (demonstrator) *Ecological  Strategies  Service*

In order to get these applications actually *developed and deployed* this analysis will tackle defining them together with their expected ins and outs. The content and goal of this work is therefore:

- To allow briefing the developers of the applications itself on the expected usage scenarioâ€™s that typical actors will walk through to achieve what specific outcomes.  
- To list and priorities actual features and expectations.

As this this should give the engineering / development team

- a clear view that inspires the design of what they should build, and which reusable components that should be made of.
- a guide to create and finetune the data-provisioning layer: i.e. the mix of (1) organised data-management, the supporting (2) discovery-, subsetting- and caching- services and (3) access-libraries that enable transparent and efficient access to the dataframes that feed these apps.
