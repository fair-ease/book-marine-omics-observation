# r-/K- microbial communities

r and K strategies refer to how organisms adapt to their environment, particularly regarding growth and resource competition. R-selected species are typically fast-growing and opportunistic, thriving in unstable environments with abundant resources, while K-selected species are slow-growing and competitive, doing well in stable, resource-limited environments with high population densities.

**r-selected species:**

1. Rapid growth: They have high growth rates (r).
2. Opportunistic: They quickly colonize unexploited environments.
3. Unstable environments: They thrive in environments with dynamic resource variations (e.g., disturbances, feast-and-famine).

**K-selected species:**

1. Slow growth: They have lower growth rates.
2. Competitive: They are specialists in competition and have a high affinity for resources.
3. Stable environments: They are well-suited for stable environments with limited resources and high population density (close to carrying capacity, K).
