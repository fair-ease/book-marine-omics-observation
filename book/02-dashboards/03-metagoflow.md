# MetaGOflow

MetaGOflow is a slim version of MGnify pipeline [1](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giad078). Both taxonomy and functioinal annotation is done from reads, however contigs are assembled using MEGAHIT too.

There are almost 60 output files from the metaGOflow pipeline. This [dashboard](https://github.com/emo-bon/momics-demos/blob/main/wf1_metagoflow/quality_control.ipynb) will provide interface to most relevant intermediate files for Quality control (QC). Other uselful notebooks will be collected [here](https://github.com/emo-bon/momics-demos/tree/main/wf1_metagoflow).
